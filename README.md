This was one of the pet projects which I did to sharpen my skills in Python

This project implements the [arts of the program that monitors news feeds  over the internet. The program will alert the user when it finds a story that matches users interest.
The feed parser is alreay implemented and my task was to implement the subclasses to parse the feeds, set up different triggers . It also has capability of reading from a text file the different triggers needed by the user
